# Getting Started with Create React App [Math Magicians: Setup]

### Learning Objectives
- Set up a React app.
- Use React documentation.
- Use React components.
- Use React props.
- Use React state.
- Handle events in a React app.
- Use React life cycle methods.
- Understand the mechanism of lifting state up.
### Description
In this project, I added the logic needed to make the Calculator component developed in the previous project to actually work

### General requirements
- No [linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Correct [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md).
- Professional work [documentation](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).
- JavaScript [best practices](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md)

### Built With
- React

### Setup instructions for Different OS's
- For [Windows](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum_support_resources/tree/main/react_and_redux/02_react_setup_windows), users.
- For [Linux](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum_support_resources/tree/main/react_and_redux/01_react_setup_linux) users.
- For [MacOS](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum_support_resources/tree/main/react_and_redux/03_react_setup_MacOS) users.
- For [Ubuntu](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum_support_resources/tree/main/react_and_redux/04_react_setup%20on%20wsl) users.

### Milestone Reached
- [x] Set up `React` App
- [x] Creatd a directory called components.
- [x] Inside components, created a new Calculator.js file.
- [x] In Calculator.js, created a React component that matches this design:
- [x] Created new directory called `logic`.
- [x] Copied the files [calculate.js](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-react-redux/blob/main/math-magicians/code-samples/calculate.js) and [operate.js](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-react-redux/blob/main/math-magicians/code-samples/operate.js) into a `logic/` directory in the project.
- [x] Installed [big.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/big-js) dependency library.
- [x] Applied `React hooks` to the Calculator.js component.
- [x] Used React Router.
- [x] Used styles in a React app.
